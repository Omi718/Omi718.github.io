		<p>You decided to go North East.</p>

		<p>Turning your flash on from your phone, you started to run through the woods at the direction North East.</p>

		<p>It was pitch black, and the last thing you wanted was to meet with a new enemy.</p>

		<p>Going as far and as fast as your legs can take you. You pray that you are going in the right direction.</p>

		<p>You feel like you've been running forever, but your adrenaline doesn't slow down. You push through because you have to make it out of this alive.</p>

		<p>You want to cry of joy once you see the road up ahead. However you're not safe yet.</p>

		<p>Hearing a ear piercing scream, and the sound of leaves quickly crunching, you look back to see that at a distance the masked lady is on your trail.</p>

		<p>She isn't as fast as before since you did wound her earlier, so that gives you an advantage.</p>

		<p>Picking up so more speed, you finally make it out of the woods. You look both sides to spot your car, and you do.</p>

		<p>Running towards it, you qickly unlock it and get inside. Locking the car once more you start the engine as you roll up the windows.</p>

		<p>Escaping is never easy. As a last resort, the she devil herself pounces at your side of the car. Sticking her hand through the gap left by the window. Her clawing at you, wanting to get you out and avenge the death of her fellow lunatic.</p>

		<p>Out of anger, you get the gun out once more and shoot at the woman through the gap. Getting her in the mask and causing her to fall back.</p>

		<p>You waste no time, in putting the car in reverse and drivng away. You didn't care about the speed limit. Your only instinct was to drive and survive.</p>

		<p>You see the girl through the mirror, laying down on the ground. Knowing how these situations sometimes play out during horror movies, you pray that she stays down.</p>

		<p>Passed 1pm, you didn't care. You drove away as fast as you could. Your first stop? The police station.</p>


		
		<p>THE END</p>
