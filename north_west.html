		<p>You decided to go North West.</p>


		<img src="C:\Users\omara\OneDrive\Pictures\HTML Story Pics\Woods At Night.jpg">

		<p>Turning your flash on from your phone, you started to run through the woods at the direction, North West.</p>

		<p>It was pitch black, and the last thing you wanted was to meet with a new enemy.</p>

		<p>Going as far and as fast as your legs can take you. You pray that you are going in the right direction.</p>

		<p>However, a new test is put infront of you as a terrifying scream is heard from behind you and a blow is given at your head.</p>

		<p>Falling to the ground,you look beside you to see who it was. The crazed masked lady had escaped from the room.</p>

		<p>You may not see her face, but you can sense her rage towards you from killing her fellow lunatic.</p>

		<p>All you see is her standing up straight once more as she grips at the metal bat.</p>

		<p>It was worth killing that mad man.</p>



		<p>GAME OVER</p>
