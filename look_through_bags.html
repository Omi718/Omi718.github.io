		<p>You decided to look through the green bags.</p>


		<img src="C:\Users\omara\OneDrive\Pictures\HTML Story Pics\Weird bags.jpg">

		<p>Quietly kneeling down, you carefully rummage through the bags to see if you find anything useful.</p>

		<p>One contained a map of what appears to be the woods and on it was marked the location of the cabin and something else. It looked like a stick figures you presumed?</p>

		<p>In the other, you found a hand gun and the pocket knife. Upon further inspection, you found out that the gun was loaded.</p>

		<p>You gulped but decided to keep it on you, after checking if the safety was on, just incase. You stashed the pocket knife inside the heel of your shoe.</p>

		<p>Continuing to look through, you cover your mouth to hold back the gasp that was about to be let through. You found a bunch of polaroid pictures scribbled with dates. Gruesome pictures. Some of which included various women, the masked lady, and a man.</p>

		<p>You take notice how all these women had similar facial features. All similar looking to Sarah. With your heart falling heavy, you continue to look through them as you find what you feared.</p>

		<p>There were photos of Sarah. Photos of these two maniacs torturing her and another of her still body. The date read October tenth. But that didn't make any sense, she texted you a few hours agao and even turned on her location so you could locate her.</p>

		<p>Frantically looking some more, you find Sarah's phone. The realization hits you. Sarah never texted you. THEY did. THEY sent you those messages and shared their location to come look for her. And you fell right into their trap.</p>

		<p>At this point your just holding back your tears.</p>

		<p>You have to get out of there. NOW!</p>

		<p>As you're about to get up, you decide to take one of these bags and shove inside the photos and the map inside too. You could take all this to the police and have them do something. In the middle of it all, you find the photo a baby. A small baby girl, no older than a year old perhaps.</p>

		<p>Not knowing why, you place it in the bag as well and get up.</p>

		<p>Carefully walking away, you come across another hallway and feeze. The white masked lady is down on the floor, laying her arm and head against the wall.</p>


		<img src="C:\Users\omara\OneDrive\Pictures\HTML Story Pics\creepy girl.jpg">

		<p>You're paralyzed for a second before taking a step back. However, you were quiet dumb as you bumped into a table which caused the vase on it to fall and break.</p>

		<p>Turning around, you see the lady with her eyes wide open. Her starting to stand up.</p>

		<p id="situation">Wil you run down to the <a href="run_to_basement.html">BASEMENT</a> , or will you push her and <a href="run_pass_her.html">RUN</a>?</p>
