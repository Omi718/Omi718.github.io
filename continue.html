		<p>You decided to continue forward but stop dead in your tracks as the masked woman appears before you.</p>

		<p>A cold sweat runs down your back as she walks towards you. You see her holding something and that alone sets you off to run.</p>

		<p>You head back towards the basement since your only chance of escape are the opened cellar doors. However, the white masked lady is close behind you.</p>

		<p>You tried running down the steps as quick as you can, but luck was not on your side. Some way, some how, she manages to throw her knife stabbing you in the back. With the mmoment you had picked up, the impact from the knife cause you to lean forward and fall down the rest of the steps.</p>

		<p>Coughing and groaning in pain, you try to crawl away. But you were not match as the lady came down and extracted her weapon from your back, making your suffering worse.</p>

		<p>The rest is faint, but you only remember her dragging you towards that secret room you were once curious about.</p>


		
		<p>GAME OVER</p>
