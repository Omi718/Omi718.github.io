		<p>You decided to turn back and head home</p>

		<p>It was getting late and it would be hard to search for Sarah in the dark. Not to mention dangerous too. Instead of saving her, I could end up getting myself in trouble too and then we're both doomed.</p>

		<p>Remembering to follow the direction of your compass on your phone, you managed to exact out of the woods just as the sky had a tint of orange and night was slowly approaching.</p>

		<p>Heading back in your car, you drove home and decided you'd come back early tomorrow morning to search for Sarah once more. Might call the police station to have a bit of help.</p>

		<p>Having arrived home, you couldn't shake this negative feeling out of your body. Ignoring it, you just went to bed and got some sleep.</P>

		<p>You decided to wake up early in the morning to head to the police station.</p>

		<p>You suddenly freeze after hearing a knock on your front door. You weren't any visitors today.</p>

		<p>Cautiously, you walk to your front door to not make any noise. Peeking at the peephole, you see that it's an officer outside of your door. Surprised, you unlock the door and greet the officer.</p>

		<p>He greets you asking for your name, to which you need your head and confirm. With the deepest sigh, he looks at you dad in the eyes.</p>

		<p>"I'm sorry to tell you this, but we found your friend, Miss Sarah Boyer, dead in the middle of the road near the woods past the highway. I'd ask if you could please come to the station to report a statement as to when you last saw her."</p>

		<p>In other shock, you don't know how to respond other than to cry and scream infront of the officer.</p>

		<p>Sarah's dead? How can she be dead?</p>

		<p>The amount of pain eating at you for the lost of your friend, you begin to wonder if things could have been different if you had stayed and continued to search for her.</p>

		<p>GAME OVER</p>
