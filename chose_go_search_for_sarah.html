		<p>You decided to go look for Sarah.</p>

		<p>Getting out of your car, you lock the doors and check your phone. You don't want to end up getting lost so you open the compass app and check the direction you're in. NORTH EAST.</P>

		<p>Sighing, you put your phone away and make your way into the woods.</p>

		<p>You called out for Sarah and kept looking around, in hopes that maybe you catch a glimpse of her. However it was proving to be difficult with the amount of trees. Not to mention you didn't want to be spinning around so much to prevent from getting lost yourself. You kept walking straight, or what you hope was straight.</p>

		<p>Huffing in frustration, you felt as if you've been walking for hours. Continuing to look around, you come across a sign with the name "Jones" in it and an arrow pointing in the direction.</p>

		<p>Looking at it confused, you look at your phone for the time and then look up at the sky. The sun was starting to set.</P>

		<p>You think about your next choice.</p>

		<p id="situation"> Will you <a href="chose_to_follow_sign.html">FOLLOW THE SIGN</a> in hopes that maybe Sarah stumbled across here and went to find shelter, or will you <a href="chose_to_head_back.html">TURN BACK</a> and head home?</p>
