		<p>You decided to go upstairs.</p>

		<p>You don't know how dangerous your situation is right now. Whatever is in the room, must not be good if it's kept locked.</p>

		<p>You carefully start heading up the stairs.</p>

		<p>Slightly cracking open the door to the cabin, you make sure no one is around. Seeing that you're safe, you come out the door and look at the room you're in.</p>

		<p>The windows are bullet proof, so escaping through them if anything were to happen is a no go.</p>

		<p>Balling up your hands into fists, you breathe out and quietly walk out the room. You had two options infront of you. The door to another room infront of you, or a hallway to your right.</p>

		

		<p id="situation">Will you check the <a href="chose_room.html">ROOM</a> infront of you, or will you go through the <a href="choose_hallway.html">HALLWAY</a>?</p>
