		<p>You decided to go in the secret room.</p>

		<p>Careful to not make any noise, you head towards the direction where the masked lady threw the keys and picked them up. Heading towards the mysterious door, you unlock it and carefully push it open.</p>

		<p>Walking inside, you in take your surroundings. It was dark, but still slightly lit. This place looked like some medieval underground cell.</p>

		<p>Looking around, you take notice of the stains on the walls and floors. A rotten smell surrounding the room, almost like death.</p>

		<p>Covering your mouth with your sweater's sleeve, you hear faint footsteps above you and you stay quiet. However, this time the masked lady wasn't alone. The voice of a man could be heard from upstairs as well.</p>

		<p>You couldn't really hear much, just muffled out screams and the heavy sound of a thud. The man screaming one more time before the sound of the front door is opened and slammed shut.</p>

		<p>Did he throw the masked girl?</p>

		<p>Hearing shuffling, the sound faints into the distance once more before going still. Sighing in relief, you decide to exit this room. At least now you know there's two of them.</p>

		<p>Turning around and heading towards the door, you notice a writing on the wall. A message. "Help me. Save her"</p>

		<p>Save her? Save who?</p>

		<p>Not wanting to stay here any longer, you quickly leave the room and head upstairs.</p>

		<p>Slightly cracking open the door to the cabin, you make sure no one is around. Seeing that you're safe, you come out the door and look at the room you're in.</p>

		<p>The windows are bullet proof, so escaping through them if anything were to happen is a no go.</p>

		<p>Balling up your hands into fists, you breathe out and quietly walk out the room. You had two options infront of you. The door to another room infront of you, or a hallway to your right.</p>

		
		<p id="situation"> Will you check the <a href="chose_room.html">ROOM</a> infront of you, or will you go through the <a href="chose_hallway">HALLWAY</a> ?</p>
