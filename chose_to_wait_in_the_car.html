		<p>You decided to wait in the car for a bit. You tried calling Sarah a few more times in hopes to get an answer. With the sun going down, you gave up and decided to drive back home. If you don't get a call within a few hours, then you'll head to the police station in the morning to see if they can help find her.</p>

		<p>Hopefully Sarah is safe and managed to find some shelter. She was a girl scout in her youth so she should be able to survive a night. Wouldn't help if I went in and then we both got lost. Who would help us then?</P>

		<p>As you drove away, you sigh at the mess your friend has gotten herself into one more.</p>


		<p>THE END</p>
