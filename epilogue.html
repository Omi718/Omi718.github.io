		<p>After safely making it back to the city, you had head straight towards the police station.</p>

		<p>You were shaking, your legs were weak, the pain in your head increasing from the punches of that man. Your vision was blury and your exhuasted body had started giving out.</p>

		<p>You screamed for help and luckily some officers rushed to your aid.</p>

		<p>After that night, you were taken to the hospital where you rested for a few days.</p>

		<p>You told the officers everything that happened. You told them about the text messages, the sign, the cottage, the people, the events. You name it, you told them.</p>

		<p>At first they didn't believe you but the chief did.</p>

		<p>Not long later, the FBI got involved and you told them everything. You even showed them the map and the photos.</p>

		<p>It wasn't long till this incident made the news. Both criminals were identified as Amy and Connor Jones.</p>

		<p>Amy was found a bit at a distance from the woods, but since she coudldn't close up her wounds, she got weaker and was found on the street near death. Connor was long dead.</p>

		<p>After doing some deep investigating, Amy and Connor Jones were found out to have been close blood related cousins. Amy had apparently been born with mental problems. Causing her to lock up, torture, and kill her family off but kept her mother alive for a bit longer than the others. However she would constantly torture her mom. The only picture ever found of her mother, was the old black and white baby photo that you had found. Apparently, Amy had a massive hatred towards her mother and Connor helped her relieve her anger by targeting females that looked like the late Mrs. Jones. Due to this Amy and Connor Jones developed a close and serious relationship. Amy was hospitalized and taken to an asylum where she'll be spending the rest of her life locked up till the end of time.</p>

		<p>All the victims had been found buried in the woods around the cottage. Even the bodies of Amy's family, with her mother included, were found under the floor of where the secret room was. After being able to identify all the bodies, they were given a proper burial.</p>

		<p>You said your final goodbye to Sarah at her own funeral. You were able to bring her justice. However, now you have to suffer through your own pain and trauma that these past events caused.</p>

		<p>You wondered what would have happened if you had made the wrong choices. Or if you never had investigated in the first place.</p>



		<p>THE END...AGAIN</p>
