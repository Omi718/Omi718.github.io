		<p>You decided to accept his help.</p>

		<p>You thank him for wanting to help you and he smiles as he says to follow him.</p>

		<p>Keeping a small distance incase things go south, you follow behind him.</p>

		<p>He starts trying to make some small talk. Asking if you found any leads regarding to your missing friend. You frown and say that you didn't. He hums and says how that's unfortunate.</p>

		<p>After sometime of walking, you both managed to arrive at the road and you spot your car. Thanking the stranger, he shakes his head and leads you back to your car.</p>

		<p>Getting inside you, you start the engine and sigh in relief, feeling safer and more comfort.</p>

		<p>You thank the man once more, who was at a distance from your window.</p>

		<p>"No worries! I do hope you manage to find your friend Sarah. Maybe you'll get a text if she manages to get a signal."</p>

		<p>Saying good bye, you put the car into reverse and then speed away. You catch a glimpse on your rearview mirror and grip at the steering wheel. You thought your eyes were playing tricks but you could have sworm you say someone hiding in the trees behind the man.</p>

		<p>After driving for some time, a scary thought comes into your mind. You never told him Sarah's name, and you never mentioned that she had texted you.</p>

		<p>You pick up some speed as the terrifying realization surfaces. What would have happened to you if you hand't managed to get out?</p>

		<p>THE END</p>
