		<p>You decided to turn and run.</p>

		<p>Denying his offer, you took a few steps back before going into full sprint. The man yelling at you to come back, not in the nice tone he was speaking in before.</p>

		<p>This time, he's the one chasing you. You mentally pray that you can make it out of this while you add more power into your legs to gain some speed.</p>

		<p>You didn't know where you were going, you just knew you had to keep running. The dark of night made it difficult to see, but your mind couldn't function to turn your flash on while you ran in fear.</p>

		<p>Sadly, that proved to have been a mistake. A wrong step was made and the leaves below you dispersed around you while you fell in a hole.</p>

		<p>The sudden impact had you in pain, but you weren't completely hurt. You had landed on something.</p>

		<p>Gasping, you sat straight up and screamed at the sight. It was Sarah, cold and still. She had cuts and gashes and marks all over he body. She looked like she got tortured. Covering your mouth to prevent another scream from coming out, you back against the wall. How did this happen? She just texted you a few hours ago but her body looked like she'd been here for much longer.</p>

		<p>You try to come back to your senses to see if you can escape this hole.</p>

		<p>You prepare yourself and jump as high as you can. Just barely reaching the edge as your feet hang off the floor. You start to try to pull yourself up to climb out, but fate isn't by your side as a scream of pain escapes your lips.</p>

		<p>Looking up, you see the man looking down at you. He just grins and you realize he his stepping on your hands as he applies your pressure.</p>

		<p>"You should've taken my help. This all could have been ignored. Sadlly, you know too much now."</p>

		<p>You wince as someone from behind grips on your hair and harshly pulls up your head. You look beside you to see a female in a white porcelein mask. She holds a knife to your throat.</p>

		<p>You look up at the man as he lets out a chuckle.</p>

		<p>"At least you got reunited with your friend once more."</p>

		<p>GAME OVER</p>
