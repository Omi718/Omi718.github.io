		<p>You decided to push pass her.</p>

		<p>Getting a large shard of glass from the floor, the masked lady lunges at you.</p>

		<p>Just barely quick enough, you use all of your weight to push back at her body and shove her to the side against the wall. Plunging the glass against her abdomen before letting go and running.</p>

		<p>Making it to what appears to be the living room, you look back to see the girl grip at her side as she takes the glass out and looks at you.</p>

		<p>You waist no time in running towards the main door and swinging open.</p>

		<p>All seems well till you see the man from the pictures right outside the door.</p>

		<p>Next thing you know, a shot is heard and you fall back. Breathing heavily, you look at to your view and see the girl and the man standing over you.</p>

		<p>"You should've turned back when you had the chance kid."</p>


		<p>GAME OVER</p>
