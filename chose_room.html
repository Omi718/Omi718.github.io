		<p>You decided to go in the room infront of you.</p>

		<p>Carefully turning the rob and pushing the door, you gasp and cover your mouth quickly. You are stunned at the sight. A single, old wooden chair. Chains. Weapons. And once more, that disgusting stench of death.</p>

		<p>Is this a torture chamber?</p>

		<p>Panicking, you back only to feel a pain in your back as something cold pierced through your abdomen with an arm holding you steady. Tearfully turning your head to the side, you see the masked lady.</p>

		<p>Coughing, you hope Sarah never came across here.</p>

		<p>GAME OVER</p>
