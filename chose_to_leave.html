		<p>You decided to leave and go look around the woods.</p>

		<p>Ignoring the creepy, old cottage, you start to walk once more but can't shake the feeling that you're beign watched.</p>

		<p>Once you think you've walked far enough from small home, you began calling out for Sarah once more.</p>

		<p>You searched for a few more hours till night consumed your surroundings. You take out your phone and use the flashlight to give you some security.</p>

		<p>You were stuck and decided that this was a lost cause. You're about to open your compass app once more till you hear the crunching of leaves.</p>

		<p>Panicking, you looked around at the direction the sound came from. Your breathing starts to stagger from the fear building up in your body. You're definitely being watched.</p>

		<p>Regretting your choice, you scream out "Who is there!?" while keeping your light on.</p>

		<p>Whatever it was, you weren't going to stand and wait any longer. Getting sensation back to your legs, you turn and run. You ran in panic that whatever is behind you is following you. And that it is.</p>

		<p>The sound of leaves constantly crunching confirmed that someone was in fact chasing after you.</p>

		<p>You couldn't help but to start screaming for help. It maybe wouldn't do any good but but one can hope.</p>

		<p>Running out of energy, you come to a stop to catch your breath. You haven't heard anything for awhile, so maybe you lost whoever was behind you. Suddenly you see a faint light and hear a voice, the voice of a man coming at a distance from infront of you.</p>

		<p>The man screams,"Hello!? Is anyone there? Hello!?"</p>

		<p>Jumping at the opportunity you scream,"Over here! I'm over here!"</p>

		<p>You hear the sound of footsteps coming towards you and the dim light getting brighter. Out from the trees, a man appears holding a lantern. You sigh in relief, "Thank you! Thank you so much! I thought I'd never be found."</p>

		<p>You get closer to the man as you introduce yourself and he does the same. You explain to him about your situation for being here, how you were looking for a friend of yours that got lost and how you were being chased by someone just now. He furrows his brows but his eyes don't look all the surprise.</p>

		<p>The man tells you how it's pretty common. These woods have been known for the dangers it leaks at night. Especially ever since the Jones family suffered a horrible fate. How I was lucky to not have gone in the cottage.</p>

		<p>Then you realize something. You never told this man about the cottage, all you mentioned ws about having arrived here to look for Sarah.</p>

		<p>A cold sweat runs down your face as fear takes over once more. The man looks at you and smiles, offering to help you exit these woods. You didn't trust that smile.</p>

		<p id="situation"> Will you <a href="chose_help.html">ACCEPT</a> his help, or will you <a href="chose_run.html">TURN AND RUN</a> ?</p>
