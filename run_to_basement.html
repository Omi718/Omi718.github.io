		<p>You decided to run to the basement.</p>

		<p>Running back down the hallway, you hear the girl try to catch up behind you. Luckily you managed to make it to the run and shut the door behind you, locking it in time.</p>

		<p>You hear her screaming and slamming her fist against the wall. For a moment you think you're safe but you were so wrong. Using a massive knife, she started stabbing the door breaking off some of the wood.</p>

		<p>You try to think of a solution. You know she isn't working alone. If you escape now, not only will she be chasing you, so will that man. You just know if won't take long for him to discover what is going on.</p>

		<p>You then remember. The secret room downstairs. You can trap her inside so you only have to deal with one.</p>

		<p>Having figured out your plan, you look at the door as you notice you have little time left before she is able to reach her hand in and unlock the door.</p> 

		<p>Hurrying down the basement, you close the door as well to buy you some time. Quickly taking hold of the keys, you unlock the secret room and run inside, leaving the door halfway open.</p>

		<p>Huffing and puffing, you sneak out the pocketknife from your shoe. Holding it at the ready, and hiding it behind your back.</p>

		<p>You hear that crazy woman scream as she comes running down and stops seeing me in the room.</p>

		<p>You slightly bend your knees, getting ready to run. She walks up at the entry and you sway the keys infront of her face, taunting her.</p>

		<p>Next thing you know, she lets out a laughter like the lunatic she is and lunges at you. On target, you swing your arm out and jab the knife against her side. Pulling it out, you shove her against the corner and run out the room, taking her knife with you.</p>

		<p>Locking the door shut and shoving the keys in your bag of evidence, you head towards the cellar doors. Near escape, you suddenly feel a force hit you back inside.</p>

		<p>Groaning in pain, you look up to see the mad man himself. He grins as he comes inside. You now have two options.</p>
