		<p>You decided to run once more.</p>

		<p>Sadly that was the biggest mistake you could make. There was barely any distance from where you were and where he was standing.</p>

		<p>And with the new concussion he gave you, your sight was blurry and your head kept spinning.</p>

		<p>And yet, you still tried.</p>

		<p>You tried to stand, and you tried to run back upstairs. However, his sense were more focus than your own.</p>

		<p>Barely making it up the flight of steps back to the house, he grabs at your ankle pulling you back. This causing you to fall and once more hit, your now bruised face, against the steps.</p>

		<p>You hear him chuckle has you let out harsh breaths. The mad man grabs at your throat, pressing you against the wall.</p>

		<p>"Who knew trying to help a friend, could get you into this much trouble?"</p>



		<p>GAME OVER</p>
