		<p>You decided to follow the sign</p>

		<p>You walked towrads the direction that the arrow was pointing to. You didn't think anyone would be living in these woods.</p>

		<p>Kinda worried, you come to a stop and hide behind a tree. You take a peek and see an old cottage. A small cottage in the middle of nowhere.</p>

		<p>There was a light on from the inside but you didn't have a good feeling about this place. It looked warn out and if people were leaving there, they should take care of the house.</p>

		<p>You didn't think it was a good idea to go knock on the front door. Walking around the house at a distance, you see that the cellar doors to the basement are wide open. Did the owner forget to close them maybe?</p>

		<p>You don't know why, but you had this itching feeling to go inside and investigate.</p>

		<p id="situation"> Will you <a href="go_in_basement.html">GO IN</a> through the cellar doors, or will you <a href="chose_to_leave.html">LEAVE</a> and go look around the woods some more?</p>
