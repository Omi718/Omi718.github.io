		<p>You decided to fight.</p>

		<p>You barely have the chance to get back up till he punches you back down once more.</p>

		<p>He gets on you and starts applying pressure at your throat.</p>

		<p>"You should've run back kid. You would've been fine since you don't look like any of them. But no, you just had to sneak inside. Now look at you? All because you wanted to help little Sarah."</p>

		<p>Any of them? Is he saying that if you ended up looking like Sarah or any of their other victims, you would've been killed the moment you arrived?</p>

		<p>Gasping for air, you frantically move around. It was more difficult since he was on top of you. But you can't die here. You have to avenge Sarah and all those other people they had hurt.</p>

		<p>Slowly losing your vision as your breathing shortens. You kick your legs around. You lay your arms on the ground as this lunatic laughs and tightens his hold on you.</p>

		<p>With his guard down, you just barely managed to get the gun out from your side. Taking the saftey off, you point it against his stomach.</p>

		<p>He hears the sound of the gun and looks down. You smirk at the devil himself and shoot. That's enough for him to let you go and stumble back as he holds his wound.</p>

		<p>You gasp for air and cough as your senses come back to you. Glaring at the wounded man down on the floor, you shakingly stand up and point the gun straight at his head.</p>

		<p>Another shot is heard and your body shakes from these current events.</p>

		<p>At first you stagger, and then you full on sprint as you exit the cellar doors. Closing them and locking them to prevent any further incident. It was pitch black outside.</p>
