		<p>You decided to go in the basement.</p>

		<p>Quietly walking to the cellar doors, you go through and make it inside.</p>

		<p>The basement looked quiet old and damaged. There was dust and garbage everywhere. Since the doors were open, a bit of light filled the room.</p>

		<p>You did not feel safe here at all, but you were stubborn and walked through the dimly lit room. Hearing a crash come from the floor above you, harsh and quick footsteps are heard and you hear the a door being unlocked.</p>

		<p>Franticly, you hide between the pipes at the dark end of the basement. Pressing your body as far back against the wall as you can.</p>

		<p>Coming down a few steps, a woman with a white mask comes and throws a bag of trash into a corner. She stands still for a moment before walking towards another door and unlocking it.<p>

		<p>It took awhile for her to come back out and lock the door before throwing the keys back and making her way up the small flight of stairs once more. After hearing it close and her footsteps fading, you finally got out of hiding.</p>

		<p>Wanting to follow her and exit this place, you walk towards the steps before freezing and looking at the mysterious door. Your curiosity picking at you.</p>
